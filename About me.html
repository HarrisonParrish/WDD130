    <h2>Harrison Parrish</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Harrison Parrish and I am a software engineering major. 
        Some of my hobbies include coding, filmmaking and music! 
    </p>
    <p>While family is very important to me, I have not gotten the chance to start one of my own and I am currently focusing on school. 
        I love BYUI as the students and staff are constantly working and kind people, no matter what I feel valued and understood. 
        It also provides me a chance to further my personal life as well as my professional life.</p>
    <p>Prior to coming to BYUI I had not considered a career in software, but on a whim I took a class on 
        programming and I absolutley fell in love with it and I completley changed my life plan so that I could incorperate software!
